However, users often struggle to extract insights and validate facts \n","from unstructured data contained within PDF files. This hackathon challenge focuses on building a \n","comprehensive PDF ingestion and querying system  that allows users to upload PDF documents, \n","automatically generate embeddings, suggest relevant questions, enable user queries, and provide \n","precise citations for validation. The solution should feature an intuitive, interactive frontend and be \n","deployable in a cloud environment.  \n"," \n","Objective:  \n","Develop an Intelligent PDF Querying System (IPQS)  with the following capabilities:  \n","1. PDF Document Ingestion : Support seamless uploading and parsing of PDF documents.  \n","2. Embedding Generation and Data Persistence : Create semantic embeddings for the content \n","within the PDFs and store them efficiently for querying.  \n","3. Question Suggestion Engine : Automatically suggest relevant questions based on the content of \n","the uploaded PDFs.  \n","4. User Querying Interface : Allow users to submit natural language queries against the PDF \n","content.  \n","5. Citation and Validation : Provide citations for the information returned in response to user \n","queries.  \n","6. Interactive Frontend : Design a user -friendly web interface for document interaction.  \n","7. Deployment : Ensure the system is deployable to a cloud environment for public access.  \n"," \n","Detailed Requirements and Criteria:  \n","1.
